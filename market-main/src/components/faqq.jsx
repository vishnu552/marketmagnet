                            HUBALT lists only promising and fully vetted startups from verticals ranging across Tech, Fintech, Social Entrepreneurship, Lifestyle etc. We prefer to bring Startups who can generate revenue in short period of time.

                            <br />
                            When a startup reaches its funding goal, we transfer the amount received from the investor to the startup's account, and issue the Share Certificate in the name of the investor.
                            However, on the downside, if a startup fails to reach the set funding target of its goal, it is unlikely that they can act on their proposed business plan. Hence, to protect the investor's funds, the raised funds are refunded.
                            Therefore, a startup either receives 100% of the funds when it reaches its funding goal, or nothing at all when it fails to.Your Money will be there in SEBI approved Escrow account until Startup reaches the funding Goal.

                            Startup funding is a long term wealth creation opportunity and its highly illiquid. Since there is no platform or exchange body where securities of the startup trade or can sell out, your investment remains highly illiquid. You get to take an exit only on the occurrence of events like Transferring the Equity to another Investor /Buyback/ M&A/ IPO.
                            We will bring facility on our platform later ,where unlisted shares of startup can be sold and transferred to other Investors who wish to buy.

                            •	Secondly, when a startup fails to reach its goal in the stipulated time frame, the raised amount will be returned to the investor and the campaign is marked closed.
                            <br />
