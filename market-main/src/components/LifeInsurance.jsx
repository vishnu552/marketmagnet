          Life insurance is a contract between an insurance company and an
          individual or group, in which the insurance company agrees to pay a
          sum of money to the named beneficiaries of the policy upon the death
          of the insured. In exchange, the policyholder pays a regular premium
          to the insurance company.

              Life insurance can help to replace the financial income that the
              family would lose if the worst was to happen. This can be
